*"run_analysis.R"* performs analysis for data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone as a Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.

To run the script you should put "run_analysis.R" into the folder with the data called "UCI HAR Dataset". You should also set the working directory to this folder, for example by the following command:
```
setwd("/Users/dennis/github/datasciencecoursera/Getting data project/UCI HAR Dataset/")
```
The result will be saved into the working directory under filename *"datasummary.txt"*

For the details about how the script works and the data structure please look at *CookBook.MD*
